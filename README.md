# Welcome to the nightmare

Hey, I’m Jace Salge, the developer behind TheRealNightmare Studios. I create games that mess with your mind—psychological horror, paranoia, and reality distortion are my specialties. From AI-driven characters to immersive environments, I push the boundaries of horror in gaming.

Check out my projects and see how I bring nightmares to life - one line of code at a time.
