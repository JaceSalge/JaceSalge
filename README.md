# Welcome to the nightmare
Hey, I’m Jace Salge, the developer behind TheRealNightmare Studios. I create games that mess with your mind—psychological horror, paranoia, and reality distortion are my specialties. From AI-driven terror to fourth-wall-breaking frights, I build experiences that stay with you long after you’ve put the controller down.

Check out my projects and see how I bring nightmares to life - one line of code at a time.
